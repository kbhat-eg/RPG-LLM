# Overview
This program (RR625R) is part of the ASOKON system and is responsible for retrieving specific report parameters from the user, validating those parameters against a reference file, and preparing the relevant fields for an eventual print or output of “accounts not included.” The main user interface is a display file (RR625D), and the code reads relevant information from disk files to ensure the requested report exists and to gather additional text or metadata for the heading.

# Structure and Flow

1. **Initialization & Parameter Handling (INZSR):**  
   - The routine retrieves and stores the firm number (l_firm) and the report identifier (p_0rap) from the input parameter list.  
   - It defaults certain time-related fields (month and year) into the period fields (a2pper and a2prør).

2. **Main Display Interaction (A2BLD):**  
   - The program displays screen A2BLD (exfmt a2bld) to the user to collect or confirm the report number (a20rap), period, and year.  
   - Pressing F3 (*INKC = *ON) sets a flag (p_in03) to '1' and immediately routes to program exit.

3. **Report Validation:**  
   - The code sets rrf0l1_0rap to a20rap and performs a chain operation (rrf0l1_key) on file RRF0L1. If the record is not found (*IN60 = *ON), it redirects back to tag A2TAGA to prompt the user again.

4. **Heading Fields Preparation:**  
   - Once validation succeeds, the program moves the report number and any descriptive text (rr0txt) into the heading fields (rhprap, rh0txt).  
   - Year and period (from the screen inputs or system defaults) are also stored (rhprør, rhpper).

5. **Exit & Cleanup (XSLUTT):**  
   - Sets *INLR = *ON and returns, ending the program.

# Key Files and Data Sources

- **AUSRL1**  
  Declared as a disk file but not heavily used in this program. It typically stores user-related information.  
- **RRF0L1**  
  Contains metadata or heading information for various reports. The chain operation ensures the requested report (a20rap / rrf0l1_0rap) exists before proceeding.  
- **RR625D** (Workstation file)  
  Houses the display formats (like A2BLD) for capturing report parameters.

# Business / Domain-Specific Logic

- The user selects a report identifier, and the program ensures that the identifier exists in the RRF0L1 reference file.  
- When valid, the program prepares the “heading” fields (rhprap, rhprør, rhpper, etc.) which are later used by downstream processes (e.g., printing routines) to label the output.  
- Pressing F3 (indicator KC) exits without proceeding, and pressing Enter triggers the validation.  

# Notable Design Points

- **Goto Labels:** The program uses tags (e.g., A2TAGA, A2TAGB, XSLUTT) for navigational flow. This is a legacy but common style in older RPG code.  
- **Field Naming Conventions:** The code uses prefixes like “rrf0l1_” for fields tied to file RRF0L1, while display or screen fields start with “a2” and heading fields with “rh.”  
- **Validation via Chain:** A chain to RRF0L1 is the key check that ensures the provided report code is recognized by the system. If not found, the user is returned to the parameter entry screen.  
- **System Fields:** The program automatically retrieves the current month and year (using *MONTH and *YEAR) for period defaults.  

Overall, RR625R primarily serves as a parameter capture and validation utility, preparing data for subsequent steps that handle the actual “accounts not included” listing.
