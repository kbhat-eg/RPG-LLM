# Overview
This RPG program, named `R950R`, is a utility designed to process and format telephone numbers. Its main purpose is to validate, clean, and reformat input phone numbers into a standardized form: `nn nn nn nn`. The program ensures only valid, purely numeric, and appropriately long input is processed.

# Program Description
- **System**: ASOKON  
- **Program Name**: R950R  
- **Purpose**: Return a cleaned and formatted phone number in the form `nn nn nn nn`.

# Program Parameters
- **p_tlfn**: A 15-character input parameter representing the phone number.

# Variables
- **w_tlfn**: A temporary string holder for the phone number during processing.
- **w_posi**: An integer position indicator used during scanning for spaces.
- **c_digi**: A constant string containing all valid digits (' 0123456789'), used to verify numeric content.

# Main Logic Breakdown

1. **Trim Input**  
   The program starts by trimming any leading or trailing spaces from `p_tlfn` and assigns it to `p_tlfn`.

2. **Validation Checks**  
   - It checks if `p_tlfn` is blank, has a length less than 8, or contains non-numeric characters, using the `%check` built-in function with `c_digi`.  
   - If any condition is true, it jumps to the `avslutt` (exit) label, terminating the program early without further processing.

3. **Remove Spaces**  
   - Copies `p_tlfn` into `w_tlfn`.  
   - Uses `%scan` to find spaces in `w_tlfn`.  
   - Enters a loop (`dow`) that continues as long as a space is found in the first 8 characters of `w_tlfn`.  
   - Inside the loop, it removes the found space by concatenating the parts before and after the space, effectively deleting all spaces from the string.  
   - After each removal, it re-evaluates the length, and if it drops below 8 characters, it exits early.

4. **Final Length Check**  
   - Checks if the length of `w_tlfn` is exactly 8 characters.  
   - If not, it terminates early.

5. **Format Telephone Number**  
   - If all checks pass, it formats `w_tlfn` into the pattern `nn nn nn nn`.  
   - It extracts substrings of two characters each and concatenates them with spaces in between.

6. **Program Termination**  
   - The `avslutt` label marks the end of processing.  
   - Sets `*inlr = *on` to indicate *last record* (typical for RPG programs that do not process multiple records).  
   - Returns control to the caller.

# Initialization Subroutine
At the end, there is an entry-point for initialization (`*inzsr`), which is a subroutine that can be called for setup purposes. It accepts the parameter `p_tlfn`.

**Summary**:  
This RPG program validates, cleans, and formats a phone number into a standard pattern. It ensures input is numeric, contains at least 8 digits, strips out any spaces, and then formats the number for display or further processing.
