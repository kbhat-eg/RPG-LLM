# Overview

This IBM ILE RPGLE program **GL208R** (title: “ASTELE Tømmer GTRTPF”) performs the following high-level tasks:  
1. Reads records from a file (`GTRTPF`).  
2. Deletes corresponding records in another file (`GTRTPFR`).  
3. Loops until a function-key indicator (*IN60*) signals exit.  
4. Cleans up and ends.

## 1. File Declaration

```rpg
FGTRTPF  UF  E   DISK
```

- **FGTRTPF**:  
  - `U` = Update file  
  - `F` = External file  
  - `E` = Error handling to program  
  - `DISK` = Disk-based physical file  
- Implied:  
  - **GTRTPF** is both input and update target.  
  - **GTRTPFR** is the “delete” file (not explicitly declared; assumed update).

## 2. Indicator Usage

| Indicator | Meaning                                        |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| *IN03     | F3 = Exit                                      |
| *IN06     | F6 = Transfer batch(es) to DIRREM              |
| *IN12     | F12 = Cancel                                   |
| *INLR     | Last-record switch: *ON = program end / cleanup|
| 60–69     | File indicators for operations (e.g., read)    |

- **60** is used to detect end-of-file on `GTRTPF`.

## 3. Main Processing Loop

```rpg
C     *IN60 = *OFF
C     DOW     *IN60 = *OFF
C     DELETE  GTRTPFR
C     READ    GTRTPF                  60
C     ENDDO
```

1. **Initialize** the file-indicator *IN60* to *OFF*.  
2. **DOW** loop continues while *IN60* is *OFF*.  
3. **DELETE GTRTPFR**  
   - Deletes the record in the physical file **GTRTPFR** that matches the current key (taken from `GTRTPF` record).  
4. **READ GTRTPF 60**  
   - Reads next record from **GTRTPF**.  
   - If end-of-file reached, the RPG runtime sets indicator 60 = *ON*, exiting the loop.  

This effectively processes every record in `GTRTPF`, deleting its counterpart in `GTRTPFR`.

## 4. Program Exit Routine

```rpg
C     XSLUTT    TAG
C               EVAL     *INLR = *ON
C               RETURN
```

- **XSLUTT** is a label/tag invoked when the program needs to terminate.  
- **EVAL *INLR = *ON** instructs RPG to close files and end the program.  
- **RETURN** returns control to the caller (or job end).

---

## 5. Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
C     *INZSR     BEGSR
C               READ     GTRTPF   60
C     ENDSR
```

- **\*INZSR** is the automatic “start-up” subroutine in RPG.  
- It attempts an initial **READ** of **GTRTPF**, setting indicator 60 if no records are found.  
- This ensures the main loop has a valid record or exits immediately if the file is empty.

---

## 6. Summary of Flow

1. **Initialization** (`*INZSR`): Read the first `GTRTPF` record.  
2. **Processing loop** (`DOW`):  
   - Delete matching record in `GTRTPFR`.  
   - Read next `GTRTPF` record until EOF.  
3. **Exit** (`XSLUTT`): Set *INLR* on, clean up, return.  

This straightforward program synchronizes two files by deleting in **GTRTPFR** every record found in **GTRTPF**.
