## High-Level Overview

This ILE RPG program is a typical subfile inquiry (query) program for IBM i (AS/400) environments. The main functionality is to show a list of "mengdekoder" (set codes) with an option to scroll or position in the list, and select a value from the subfile to return.

Much of the documentation is in Norwegian, but the code structure follows standard IBM RPG subfile patterns.

## Key Components

### Header and Options

```rpg
h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- `*nodebugio`: Disables debug for I/O operations.
- `*dmy`: Edits dates as Day/Month/Year.

### File Definitions

```rpg
fra15l1    if   e           k disk    rename(ra15pfr:ra15l1r)
fra15l2    if   e           k disk    rename(ra15pfr:ra15l2r)

fra515d    cf   e             workstn sfile(b1sfl:w_srrn)
```
- Two physical files, `fra15l1` and `fra15l2`, are defined for read operations (with keys).
- `fra515d` represents the display file, with a subfile (`b1sfl`), and the relative record number tracked by `w_srrn`.

---

### Data Definitions

- **Parameters:** `p_firm`, `p_okod`, `p_otxt` are parameter fields for company, code, and description, respectively.
- **Working Variables:** Used for subfile record counting, paging, and navigation.
- **Constants:** `c_sfil` defines subfile page size (initialized to 8).

---

### Indicator Usage

The program uses classic RPG indicators (e.g., *IN10, *IN11) for operations such as roll up/down, subfile control, clearing, and error indicators.

---

### Main Program Loop Structure

- Program starts at tag `b2taga`, writes the command screen (`b2cmd`), then enters the main logic.
- Control alternates between displaying the subfile, handling user input, and responding to function keys.
- Key subroutines handle refreshing the subfile, positioning, loading pages, clearing, and logic for moving forward/backward through the list.

---

## Subfile Paging and Navigation

- **crt_subfile**: Reads records from the physical file and loads a "page" into the subfile.
- **clr_subfile**: Clears the subfile area and resets related counters.
- **bck_subfile**: Reads a previous page of records and refreshes the subfile.
- **subfile**: Handles user input/selection in the subfile and updates internal variables or returns a selection.

---

## Subroutines Explained

### **forny (Refresh subfile)**
- Optionally chains to a specific subfile record if positioned, sets the file pointer accordingly, and reloads the subfile.

### **posisjoner (Positioning)**
- Allows positioning either by code or description:
    - If a code is entered, positions the file accordingly.
    - If a description is entered, positions accordingly.
- Clears, refreshes the subfile, then blanks the positioning fields.

### **crt_subfile (Create subfile)**
- Loads a page of records into the subfile from the relevant file (depending on mode: by code or description).
- Protects against reading past EOF or switching company.

### **clr_subfile (Clear subfile)**
- Signals the subfile should be cleared and writes the control record; resets all paging and counters.

### **bck_subfile (Back a subfile page)**
- Reads the previous page, updating the display accordingly.

### **dsp_subfile (Display subfile)**
- If the subfile contains records, sets indicators to display the subfile, otherwise displays the command screen.

### **subfile (Subfile handler)**
- Handles toggling the "cursor placement" indicator, reads entries from the subfile, and handles selection: if a row is marked as selected, updates parameters and flags selection complete.

### **\*inzsr (Initialization)**
- Handles parameters passed into the program, initializes the keys and variables, positions to the start, and loads the first subfile page.

## Function Key Handling

- `select` block handles function keys:
    - *INKC, *INKL: Exit program.
    - *INKE: Refresh subfile.
    - *IN10: Roll subfile forward.
    - *IN11: Roll subfile backward.
    - *IN21: Home-key, triggers cursor repositioning.

---

## Key Lists (KLISTs)

- `ra15l1_key` and `ra15l2_key` define composite keys for positioning on code or description, including the company.

---

## Subfile Field/Screen Explanation

- `b1sfl` is the subfile record format.
- `b2ctl` is the subfile control record.
- `b2cmd` is a command screen for function keys.
- Navigation and command screens are swapped in/out as required.

---

## Summary

This ILE RPG program implements a classic subfile lookup with paging, positioning, and selection, using traditional RPG indicators and subfile logic. All business logic is well-encapsulated in subroutines, and the program is well-commented (in Norwegian) with explicit mapping of indicators and variables to user interface functions.

The code is a good example for onboarding into RPG-based subfile applications, demonstrating:
- Subfile creation and management
- Paging (forward and back)
- Keyboard handling and navigation
- Passing parameters back and forth
- Standard subfile indicator usage
- Data positioning within files

If you are new to RPG subfile programming, focus on how the subfile is loaded (`crt_subfile`), cleared (`clr_subfile`), and the user interaction is managed (function key handling and subfile read/selection logic).
