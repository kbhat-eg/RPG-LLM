# Program Overview
This RPG IV program, named JX520R, is designed to display vendor prices while only showing accounts receivable (reskontro lev). It is a menu-driven application that interacts with multiple database files (sefiles) and subfiles to present data and handle user input.

# Main Program Options
- `h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)`: Sets program options to disable debug I/O and mark the date for the program.
- Comments detail system information, description, version history, and usage of indicators for controlling screen flow and subfile operations.

# File Definitions
- Several files (`fjvprl1`, `fjvarl1`, `fjlevl1`, `fjvpkl1`) are mapped as keyed disk files, used to access different database records.
- `f` indicates file definitions, with `e` (if present) denoting error handling on disk operations.
- `rename` statements assign alternate record formats for ease of reference.

# Data Structures and Variables
- **Parameter Variables (`p_vare`, `p_enum`)**: These are input parameters, likely passed from calling programs, used to specify a specific vendor or enumeration.
- **Local Data Area (`LDA`)**: Used for internal process storage (e.g., `l_fnav` for filename, possibly for logging or debugging).
- **Display Feedback (`dspfbk`)**: A data structure to hold feedback information for the display, such as an indicator for the current record position (`d_fcrn`).

# Record Format Variables
- Variables like `jvprl1_ldor`, `jvarl1_vare`, etc., are working copies of database record formats used during processing, initialized based on current records read from files.

# Working Variables
- Numerical and string variables (`w_fcrn`, `w_stel`, `w_spge`, etc.) hold temporary values like record counters, positions, or specific field values.
- `b_valg_ok` is a flag indicating if a selection was successful.
- `w_vare` is a copy of the vendor code, used for operations within the program.
- `c_sfil` is a constant used for subfile page sizing.

# Comments on Special Fields
- Fields such as `w_fcrn`, `w_stel`, `w_spge`, etc., are used for managing subfile display logic, including record positioning, pagination, screen cursor location, and activity indicators.

# Screen and Subfile Definitions
- Multiple screen formats (`B1SFL`, `B2CTL`, `B2CMD`, `C2BLD`) handle subfile displays and user interaction.
- Control records and command screens manage subfile actions and navigation.

# Core Logic: Subfile Handling
### Subfile Display
- `dsp_subfile`: Displays the subfile, setting screen indicators and invoking display formats.

### Subfile Clearing
- `clr_subfile`: Clears the subfile, resets indicators and counters.

### Filling Subfile
- `crt_subfile`: Loads data into the subfile by reading records and writing them into the display subfile. It uses `read` to sequentially fetch records, checking for matching vendor or package data.

### Positioning in Subfile
- `posisjoner`: Positions the subfile cursor to a specific record based on the vendor or package key. It reads records sequentially to locate the desired position.

### Navigating Back in Subfile
- `bck_subfile`: Reads previous pages in the subfile, enabling backward navigation by reading records in reverse order.

### Displaying Subfile
- Re-invokes display format with indicators to refresh the screen with current subfile data.

### Tearing Down Subfile
- `exsr` calls to clear and fill subfiles ensure the display is consistent with data changes.

# User Interaction / Function Keys Handling
- The code handles function keys (`*inkc`, `*inkl`, `*inke`) with `select` and `when` statements.
- Commands like `avslutt` (terminate), `forny` (refresh), `crt_subfile` (create), and `bck_subfile` (back) control flow based on user actions.

# Program Termination
- `avslutt`: Sets *inlr = *on to indicate end of program and returns to caller.

# Subroutines (External Procedure Calls)
### Forny (Refresh)
- Checks current page, resets pointers, clears, and recreates the subfile.

### Posisjoner (Position)
- Positions the cursor and page in the subfile based on vendor code or other key.

### `exsr` Calls
- `clr_subfile`, `crt_subfile`, `posisjoner`, `subfile`, `bck_subfile`, and `dsp_subfile` are subroutines that modularize tasks like clearing, creating, navigating, and displaying subfiles.

# Summary
This RPG program provides a user interface for browsing vendor price data, utilizing subfiles for efficient display and navigation. It handles keyboard input to control pagination, refresh, and termination. The code is well-structured with subroutines that encapsulate specific functionalities like subfile management, positioning, and display, making it easier to maintain and understand.
