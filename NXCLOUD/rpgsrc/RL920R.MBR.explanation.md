## RPG Source Code Explanation

This ILE RPG program appears to handle year-end processing for supplier (leverandør) records, as suggested by the Norwegian comments ("Årsrutine - leverandører").

### Header Specifications

- `h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)`
  - `*nodebugio` disables additional debugging of I/O.
  - `datedit(*dmy)` sets the default date format to Day-Month-Year for this program.

### File Specification

- `frlevlu    upe  e           k disk    rename(rlevpfr:rlevlur)`
  - Declares logical file `RLEVLU` for update (`upe`) and keyed access (`k disk`).
  - The external record format `rlevpfr` is renamed to internal format name `rlevlur`.

### Main Calculation Logic

The key processing occurs in the main calculation specs:

```rpg
c                   eval      rlsaif = rlsald
c                   eval      rlkj�f = rlkj�p
c                   eval      rlkj�p = 0
c                   update    rlevlur
```

- `rlsaif = rlsald`  
  Copies the value from current year balance (`rlsald`) to previous year balance (`rlsaif`).

- `rlkj�f = rlkj�p`  
  Copies a current year amount or counter (`rlkj�p`) to a previous year field (`rlkj�f`). The `�` likely represents a Norwegian letter (e.g., `ø`), so the field names are language-specific.

- `rlkj�p = 0`  
  Resets the current year amount or counter to zero, preparing for a new year.

- `update rlevlur`  
  Writes the updated record back to the file.

### Structure

- `slutt tag`  
  Defines a label/tag called `slutt`. No `goto` or branching to this tag is shown in this snippet.

### Subroutine Initialization

- The `*inzsr` subroutine is a standard RPG special routine that runs during program initialization.
- As shown, it's empty, so no specific initialization logic is performed.

### Comments & Metadata

- Extensive block comments at the top describe the system, program name, purpose, and other metadata in Norwegian.
- There is a section for references and change history, which is currently blank.

## Summary

This program reads supplier records and performs end-of-year roll-over:

- It copies the current year totals/balances to corresponding previous year fields.
- It zeroes out the current year fields for the new accounting period.
- It updates each supplier record accordingly.

**Note:** The actual reading of records and looping logic is not shown in this snippet, so the code may be part of a larger batch process.
