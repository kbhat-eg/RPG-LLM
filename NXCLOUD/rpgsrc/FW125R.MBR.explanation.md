# Overview
This RPG source code is designed to update products and prices in an IBM i (AS/400) system, specifically for the program named "FW125R". It is a parameter-driven application that manages product data, pricing, and related information, with user interface support for data entry and validation.

# Title & Documentation
The header comments provide comprehensive details:
- Program title: "ASOFAK Lev.vare, oppdaterer varer/priser - parameter"
- System: ASOFAK
- Description: Updates products/prices with input parameters
- Version history and change notes dating back to 1999, reflecting updates like GUI adaptations.

# File Definitions & Renaming
The code defines several files:
- `frlevl1`, `fvogrl1`, `fvhgrl1`, `fvugrl1`: Files related to supplier, overgroup, main group, and subgroup respectively. These are open files with specific keys used for lookups.
- `ffw125d`: Work station file for user interaction (likely a display or input screen). It's renamed from the actual file for clarity and easier referencing.

# Data Structures & Variables
- **Local Data (UDS)**: Contains `l_firm`, a 3-digit firm number, and `l_fnav`, a character string possibly for navigation or display.
- **Keys and Record Variables**: These variables (`rlevl1_levr`, `vogrp`, `vhgrp`, `vugrp` etc.) are structures that mimic records in the database files, defined "like" other data structures.
- **Other Variables**: Flags (`b_feil`), date variables (`w_udat`, `w_dato`), and a `w_firm` structure for firm info.

# Main Program Flow
### Initialization
- The program sets the current date (`w_udat`) and moves it into `b1dato`.
- It initializes the screen (`exfmt b1bld`) and processes user input.
  
### User Interaction & Input Handling
- The program interprets function keys like *INKC, *INKD, which could be for commands like "Cancel", "Help", etc.
- It performs validation via `exsr sjekk_input`, setting error flags if input data is invalid.
- If errors are found, it resets the error flag and redisplays the screen.

### Data Transfer & Processing
- Calls external program `'FW126R'`, passing multiple parameters related to the update operation such as firm, product group, prices, dates, etc.

### Termination
- When done, it sets `*INLR = *ON` to indicate the program should end and returns control.

# Subroutines
### `spørring` (Inquiry)
Handles data inquiries based on which field the user is referencing.
- Depending on `w_afld` (field identifier), it calls other programs (`RL500R`, `VG510R`, etc.) to look up supplier, overgroup, main group, or subgroup data.
- It prepares necessary parameters and relays input/output values for these lookups.

### `sjekk_input` (Check Input)
Validates the user-entered data:
- Checks the supplier number (`b1ldor`) exists.
- Checks group numbers (`b1ogrp`, `b1hgrp`, `b1ugrp`) for valid references.
- Validates product number, date, and prices.
- Ensures no required price fields are omitted if one is provided.
- Sets `b_feil` to `*ON` if any validation fails, triggering error handling.

### `*inzsr` (Initialization Subroutine)
Prepares the environment:
- Loads the firm number from a logical data area (`l_firm`).
- Sets default values for the screen fields, such as `b1otyp` (probably indicating the type of operation, e.g., update).

# Summary
This RPG code forms the backbone of a product and pricing update system with interactive user input, validation, and integration with other lookup programs. Its structure emphasizes data validation and seamless navigation through supplier and product hierarchies, making it suitable for maintaining complex item master data efficiently.
