## Overview

This RPG (Report Program Generator) IV program is written for the IBM i (AS/400, iSeries) platform. The main purpose of the program is to reset (nullify) specific date and time fields in two physical files related to product records—one for regular products and one for deleted products. It also updates tracking or audit fields to record who performed the update and when.

## Header Specifications

- `h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)`: 
  - `*nodebugio`: Disables RPG cycle debug I/O.
  - `datedit(*dmy)`: Sets the default date format to Day-Month-Year.

## File Declarations

Two logical files related to products are declared:

```rpg
fvvarlu    uf   e           k disk    rename(vvarpfr:vvarlur)
fvvaslu    uf   e           k disk    rename(vvaspfr:vvaslur)
```

- `vvarlu`
  - File usage: update (`uf`), externally described (`e`), keyed (`k`), and on disk.
  - Renames the record format from `vvarpfr` to `vvarlur`.
- `vvaslu`
  - Similarly, for deleted products, record format renamed from `vvaspfr` to `vvaslur`.

## Local Data Area

```rpg
d                uds
d l_user                911    920
```
- Declares the User Data Structure (`uds`) which maps to the RPG program’s local data area.
- `l_user` occupies positions 911 to 920, likely contains the user ID running the program.

## Main Program Logic

### Section 1: Active Products

Iterates over all records in the active product file (`vvarlu`/`vvarlur`). For each product:

- Reads the first record, then loops while not `end-of-file`.
- Sets fields `vvnuda` and `vvudat` (presumably new date fields) to their lowest possible value (`*loval`).
- Sets audit fields:
  - `vvedat`: Current date/time (`time` op code).
  - `vvetim`: Current time.
  - `vveusr`: User ID (from LDA - `l_user`).
- Updates the record, then reads the next, until EOF is reached.

### Section 2: Deleted Products

Iterates over all deleted product records (`vvaslu`/`vvaslur`). For each record:

- Reads the first record, then loops while not `end-of-file`.
- Sets fields `vvnuda`, `vvudat`, `vvsdat`, and `vvstim` to their lowest value.
- Sets audit fields as in previous section.
- Updates the record, then reads the next, until EOF is reached.

### Program Termination

- *inlr = *on: Sets the last record indicator—tells RPG runtime to close files and clean up storage.
- `return`: Exits the program.

### Subroutine Section

A placeholder for the *INZSR (initialization subroutine), which is empty in this code.

## Comments and Documentation

- The comments are in Norwegian, and provide information about program purpose, version history, and the logic steps.
- Example: "Nullstiller nye datofelter på varer og slettede varer" means "Resets new date fields on products and deleted products".

## Summary

**Main activities:**

- For every "product" and "deleted product" record:
  - Date and time fields are cleared (nullified).
  - Audit information (user, date, time of update) is recorded.
- Program is designed to help "reset" certain fields, likely before a change of process or period (e.g., starting a new accounting year).

**Key RPG Techniques Used:**

- Sequential processing with READ, DOW (%EOF), UPDATE.
- Use of Local Data Area for current user.
- Date/time stamping using `TIME`.
- Standard RPG IV free-format code, but with some legacy fixed-form elements.
