## Overview

This ILE RPG program (RE632R) is designed for IBM i / AS400 systems. Its comment header explains that it prints labels for the "Nexstep Archive" ("Skriver etiketter til Nexstep Arkiv"). The program interacts with a display file (WORKSTN device), collects data from the user, and calls another program (RF011C) to handle the label printing.

## Key Sections Explained

### Header Specs

```rpg
h datedit(*dmy) option(*nodebugio)
```
- `datedit(*dmy)`: Dates are edited in day-month-year format.
- `option(*nodebugio)`: Disables debugging of input/output operations, potentially for performance.

---

### File Declarations

```rpg
fre632d    cf   e             workstn
```
- Declares a display file (`re632d`) for communication with a workstation device (`workstn`).

---

### Data Structure Declarations

```rpg
d                uds
d l_user                911    920
d l_firm                944    946  0
d l_fnav                951    980
```
- Declares an unnamed data structure (UDS).
- Element definitions are for overlaying (or mapping) data at specific positions (possibly from a user space).
- `l_user`: Characters 911-920 (user ID?).
- `l_firm`: Positions 944-946 (likely a numeric firm/company code).
- `l_fnav`: Positions 951-980.

---

### Working Variables

```rpg
d w_biln          s              6  0
d w_firm          s              3  0
```
- `w_biln`: 6-digit (packed) numeric variable for billing/document number.
- `w_firm`: 3-digit (packed) numeric variable for firm/company code.

---

### Main Program Logic

#### Program Start and Input

```rpg
c/eject

c     a2taga        tag

c                   exfmt     a2bld
```
- `a2taga tag`: Defines a label in the code.
- `exfmt a2bld`: Displays and edits a workstation record (format `a2bld`) - prompts user for input.

---

#### Exit Condition

```rpg
c                   if        *inkc = *on
c                   goto      slutt
c                   endif
```
- Checks the `*INKC` indicator (typically "F3=Exit" or similar). If active, goes to `slutt` (end/exit label).

---

#### Parameter Preparation

```rpg
c                   eval      w_biln = a2bilf
```
- Sets starting billing/document number (`w_biln`) from the screen field `a2bilf`.

---

#### Main Loop: Processing Labels

```rpg
c                   dow       w_biln < a2bilt + 1

c                   call      'RF011C'
c                   parm                    w_firm
c                   parm                    a2raar
c                   parm                    w_biln

c                   eval      w_biln = w_biln + 1

c                   enddo
```
- Loops from the starting number (`a2bilf`) up to and including `a2bilt`.
- For each value:
    - Calls program `RF011C`, passing:
        - `w_firm`: Company code.
        - `a2raar`: (presumably) year.
        - `w_biln`: Current bill/document number.
- Increments `w_biln`.

---

#### Cleanup and Repeat

```rpg
c                   eval      a2bilf = 0
c                   eval      a2bilt = 0

c                   goto      a2taga
```
- Resets input fields.
- Returns to the input prompt (label `a2taga`).

---

#### Program End

```rpg
c     slutt         tag

c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- `slutt` is the program end label.
- `*INLR = *ON` signals program end and closes files.
- `return` exits the program.

---

### Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr

c                   eval      a2raar = *year
c                   eval      w_firm = l_firm

c                   endsr
```
- *INZSR is the RPG initialization subroutine.
- Sets `a2raar` to the current year.
- Sets `w_firm` to value from `l_firm` (from user space/data area).

---

## Key Points for Developers

- **Display file driven:** The program is interactive, prompting users for input via the display file.
- **Label printing loop:** For each document number in the given range, a print program is called.
- **Data mapping:** Some variables are mapped to specific positions in a user space or data area, likely for session/user context.
- **External subprogram call:** Actual label printing happens in separate program (`RF011C`).

---

## Variables to Watch

- `a2bilf` / `a2bilt`: Range of billing/document numbers entered by the user.
- `a2raar`: Year (auto-filled at initialization).
- `w_firm`: Company code (taken from environment/user data).

---

## Workflow in Summary

1. **Program starts; initializes year and firm.**
2. **User provides a range of numbers (`a2bilf` to `a2bilt`) on display.**
3. **For each number in the range:**
   - Calls `RF011C` to print a label.
4. **Fields are cleared; user is prompted again.**
5. **Repeat until user exits (F3 or similar).**

---

**This structure is typical for "label/printing request" programs on IBM i, separating user input, looping over items, and delegating the printing logic to a dedicated subprogram.**
