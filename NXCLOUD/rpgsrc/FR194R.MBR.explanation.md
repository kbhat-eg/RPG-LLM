## Overview

This RPG (Report Program Generator) program, named **FR194R**, is designed for the IBM i (AS/400) system. The main purpose is to check whether a customer exists in a discount matrix during the process of copying an agreement. The code uses fixed-format ILE RPG and interacts with a physical file (`rkunpfr`) representing the customer master.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. **Header and Options**
```rpg
h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- `option(*nodebugio)`: Disables certain debug I/O operations for better performance.
- `datedit(*dmy)`: Sets the default date edit code to day/month/year.

---

### 2. **File Declaration**
```rpg
frkunl1    if   e           k disk    rename(rkunpfr:rkunl1r)
```
- Declares file `rkunpfr` (customer master) for input with keyed access. 
- The record format is renamed locally to `rkunl1r`.

### 3. **Data Definitions**

#### Parameters
```rpg
d p_firm          s                   like(rkfirm)
d p_kund          s                   like(rkkund)
d p_feil          s              1
```
- `p_firm`: Company code, same data type as `rkfirm`.
- `p_kund`: Customer number, matches type of `rkkund`.
- `p_feil`: Error flag (1-char), signals if the customer is found (*'0'* or *'1'*).

#### Working Variables
```rpg
d rkunl1_kund     s                   like(rkkund)
d b_feil          s              1    inz(*off)
d w_firm          s                   like(rkfirm)
```
- `rkunl1_kund`: Temporary for customer key.
- `b_feil`: Boolean error flag, initialized to *off* (false).
- `w_firm`: Temporary for company code.

---

### 4. **Main Program Logic**

#### a. **Initialization**
```rpg
c                   eval      p_feil = *off
```
- Assumes no error (customer will be found).

#### b. **Set Key Fields**
```rpg
c                   eval      rkunl1_kund = p_kund
```
- Assigns the input customer number to the search key.

#### c. **Customer Lookup**
```rpg
c     rkunl1_key    chain     rkunl1
```
- Attempts to read the customer record using composite key (`rkunl1_key`).

#### d. **Check Result**
```rpg
c                   if        not %found
c                   eval      p_feil = *on
c                   goto      avslutt
c                   endif
```
- If not found: set error flag (`p_feil = *on`), skip to program end.

---

### 5. **End of Program**
```rpg
c     avslutt       tag
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- `*inlr = *on`: Closes files, signals RPG job end.
- `return`: Exits the program.

---

### 6. **Initialization Subroutine (`*inzsr`)**

#### Parameter List
```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
c     *entry        plist
c                   parm                    p_firm
c                   parm                    p_kund
c                   parm                    p_feil
```
- The subroutine is run at program start and sets up the parameter list.

#### Key List for File Lookup
```rpg
c     rkunl1_key    klist
c                   kfld                    w_firm
c                   kfld                    rkunl1_kund
```
- `klist` defines the composite key: company and customer.

#### Company Assignment
```rpg
c                   eval      w_firm = p_firm
```
- Receives the company code from the call parameter and assigns to working variable.

#### End Subroutine
```rpg
c                   endsr
```
- Ends the initialization subroutine.

---

## **Summary**

- The program receives three parameters: company code, customer number, and an error flag.
- It looks up a customer in the `rkunpfr` file for the provided company.
- If the customer does not exist, `p_feil` is set to true (on).
- The program uses classic RPG fixed-format style and is generally used as a validation module in larger business logic chains.

**Key Concepts for Onboarding:**
- This is a subroutine-style validation program using standard AS/400 file access.
- Most logic is about parameter passing, key setting, and result signaling.
- Understanding the RPG fixed-format and file/key declarations is essential.
