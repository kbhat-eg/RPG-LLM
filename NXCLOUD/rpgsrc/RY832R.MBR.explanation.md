# RPG Source Code Explanation

## Overview

This RPG III/400 (ILE RPG) program is named **RY832R** and runs on the **ASVADM** system. Its main function, as per the description, is to "**Fjerner leverandører uten varer og priser**," which translates from Norwegian to "**Removes suppliers without items and prices**." The program scans through a supplier master file and deletes supplier records if they have neither items nor prices in the related files.

## 1. Header and Options

```rpg
h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- **option(*nodebugio)**: Disables certain debug information for I/O operations.
- **datedit(*dmy)**: Sets the date format to day/month/year.

## 2. File Declarations

### Output/Update File

```rpg
fjlevlu    uf   e           k disk    rename(jlevpfr:jlevlur)
```
- **fjlevlu**: File name used in program, update-capable, external file, keyed, disk file.
- **rename(jlevpfr:jlevlur)**: Uses external definition `jlevpfr`, but referenced as `jlevlur` in the program.
- This is the **supplier master file**: records here represent suppliers.

### Input-Only Files

```rpg
fjvarl5    if   e           k disk    rename(jvarpfr:jvarl5r)
fjvprl2    if   e           k disk    rename(jvprpfr:jvprl2r)
```
- **fjvarl5**: Item file, input-only, external, keyed.
- **fjvprl2**: Price file, input-only, external, keyed.
- These files relate items and prices to suppliers.

## 3. Variable Definitions

```rpg
d w_ldor          s                   like(jlldor)
```
- **w_ldor**: Work variable, same data type as `jlldor` (probably the supplier number or key field).

---

## 4. Main Program Logic

### Main Loop

```rpg
c                   read      jlevlur
c                   dow       not %eof
   ...
c                   read      jlevlur
c                   enddo
```

- **read jlevlur**: Reads the next supplier record.
- **dow not %eof**: Continues loop until the end of the supplier file.

### Record Handling and Deletion

```rpg
c                   eval      w_ldor = jlldor

c     key01         chain     jvarl5
c                   if        not %found
c     key01         chain     jvprl2
c                   if        not %found
c                   delete    jlevlur
c                   endif
c                   endif
```

- For each supplier, stores the key field (`jlldor`) in the work variable `w_ldor`.
- **Key List `key01`** is used for lookups (see subroutine below).
- **chain jvarl5**: Attempts to find this supplier in the item file.
  - If **not found** in item file,
  - **chain jvprl2**: Tries to find supplier in the price file.
    - If **not found** in both, **delete jlevlur**: removes supplier record.

In other words:  
> If the supplier has neither items nor prices, delete them from the master file.

## 5. End of Program

```rpg
c     avslutt       tag
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- **avslutt tag**: Label (probably unused except for structuring).
- **eval *inlr = *on**: Signals RPG to close files and reclaim resources.
- **return**: Exits the program.

---

## 6. Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
c     key01         klist
c                   kfld                    w_ldor
c                   endsr
```
- **Subroutine *inzsr**: Runs automatically at program start.
- **key01 klist**: Defines a key list (used for keyed I/O).
  - **kfld w_ldor**: Adds `w_ldor` as a key field (the supplier number).

This key list is later used in the `chain` statements for the item and price file lookups.

---

## 7. Key Points for Onboarding

- **Supplier records** are only deleted if there are **no items and no prices** associated with them.
- The program is efficient: as soon as a supplier is found in either the item or price file, deletion is skipped.
- All file accesses are keyed (improves performance).
- Initialization is minimal: just sets up the key list.
- The program runs sequentially over the supplier file.
- **File/field names** are in Norwegian, so understanding the business logic may require familiarity with the terminology.

---

## 8. File Relationships

- **jlevlur (Supplier Master)**: Records may be deleted.
- **jvarl5r (Item)**: Checked for related items per supplier.
- **jvprl2r (Price)**: Checked for related prices per supplier.

---

## 9. How to Modify

- To add other criteria for deletion, modify the condition inside the main loop.
- To change which keyfields are used, adjust the key list in `*inzsr`.

## 10. Summary

**This program performs a cleanup of suppliers, ensuring that only suppliers with current items or prices remain in the master file. It uses straightforward, efficient RPG logic and is a good example of batch maintenance programs common on IBM i systems.**
