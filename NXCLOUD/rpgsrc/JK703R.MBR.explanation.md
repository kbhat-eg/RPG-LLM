# RPG Program Overview

This ILE RPG program (`lx700rla`) is designed for the ASOFAK system, with a description indicating it's related to timber assortment and input parameters. It's tailored for "Bergersen" and was created on 2022-10-18 by "bof".

Below, the code is explained section-by-section for easy onboarding:

---

## Header Specifications

```rpg
h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- `*NODEBUGIO`: Disables I/O debugging for efficiency.
- `*DMY`: Dates are edited in Day/Month/Year format.

---

## File Declarations

```rpg
fjk703d    cf   e             workstn
```
- Declares `fjk703d` as a workstation display file, enabling screen I/O.

---

## Data Definitions

### Local Data Area (LDA)
```rpg
d                uds
d l_firm                944    946  0
```
- `uds`: Declares usage of the User Data Section (LDA).
- `l_firm`: A 3-digit zone (0 decimals) field from positions 944–946 of the LDA. Usually stores company number/id for session context.

### Program Variables

```rpg
d b_feil          s              1    inz(*off)
d w_firm          s              3  0
```
- `b_feil`: 1-character indicator initialized to off (*OFF). The name suggests an error flag ("feil" = "error" in Norwegian).
- `w_firm`: 3-digit, 0 decimals—used to store the firm number in working storage.

## Mainline Logic

### Processing the Opening Screen

```rpg
c     b1taga        tag
c                   exfmt     b1bld
```
- `b1taga tag`: Label for start of main processing.
- `exfmt b1bld`: Displays and writes the format `b1bld` (likely a screen/input panel from the display file) and waits for user input.

### Function Key Processing

```rpg
c                   select
c                   when      *inkc or *inkl
c                   goto      avslutt
c                   endsl
```
- Checks if function keys `F3` (`*INKC`) or `F12` (`*INKL`) are pressed.
- If so, jumps to the `avslutt` label (exit/terminate program).
- Otherwise, continues.

### Calling Another Program

```rpg
c                   call      'JK704R'
```
- Calls another RPG program named `JK704R` (possibly to process further or perform subfunction).

---

## Program Exit

```rpg
c     avslutt       tag
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- `avslutt tag`: Label for clean termination.
- `*INLR = *ON`: Set LR (Last Record) indicator to ON, closing files and signaling program end.
- `return`: Exits the program.

---

## Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
c                   eval      w_firm = l_firm
c                   endsr
```
- `*INZSR BEGSR ... ENDSR`: Initialization subroutine, run when the program starts.
- Sets `w_firm` (working variable) to the value of `l_firm` from the LDA, initializing the session context for the user's firm.

---

## Summary

- **Purpose:** Initializes company context, displays a screen, processes function keys, and potentially calls another program for additional processing.
- **Screen Exit:** Ends cleanly on F3 or F12.
- **Initialization:** Copies company info from the LDA for use during the session.
- **Customization:** Contains Norwegian comments and terminology, suggesting it is written for a Norwegian business context.

This structure is typical for RPG interactive programs—initialization, main screen loop with input, branch on function keys, exit handling, and initial session setup.
