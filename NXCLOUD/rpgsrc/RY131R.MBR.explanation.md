## Overview

This is an IBM ILE RPG (RPG IV) program, named `RY131R`, designed to **delete prices ("priser") for a specific hardcoded supplier ("leverandør")**. The main logic reads records from a file, checks for a matching product in another file with a specified supplier number, and deletes corresponding price entries.

### File Declarations

```rpg
fjvarl8    uf   e           k disk    rename(jvarpfr:jvarl8r)
fjvprl1    uf   e           k disk    rename(jvprpfr:jvprl1r)
```
- **jvarl8**: Disk file, externally described, keyed access. Renamed from `jvarpfr` to `jvarl8r`.
- **jvprl1**: Disk file, externally described, keyed access. Renamed from `jvprpfr` to `jvprl1r`.

### Variable Definitions

```rpg
d jvarl8_ldor     s                   like(jvldor)
d jvprl1_vare     s                   like(jxvare)
d jvprl1_ldor     s                   like(jxldor)
```
- These are **work variables matching fields in the files**:
  - `jvarl8_ldor` — supplier number for file jvarl8.
  - `jvprl1_vare` — item number for file jvprl1.
  - `jvprl1_ldor` — supplier number for file jvprl1.

### Main Processing Logic

#### Initial Setup

```rpg
c                   eval      jvarl8_ldor = 54901
c     jvarl8_key    setll     jvarl8
c     jvarl8_key    reade     jvarl8                                 90
c                   dow       *in90 = *off
```
- **Set the supplier number to `54901`**.
- Position the read on `jvarl8` at the start of records with `jvarl8_key`.
- Read the next record with the same key (supplier), set indicator 90 if EOF.

#### For Each Record

```rpg
c                   eval      jvprl1_vare = jvvare
c                   eval      jvprl1_ldor = 59097
c     jvprl1_key    chain     jvprl1                             91
c                   if        *in91 = *off
c                   delete    jvprl1r
c                   endif
```
- For each item read:
  - `jvprl1_vare` ← current item number from `jvarl8` (`jvvare`).
  - **Set supplier to `59097`** (hardcoded as per the program description).
  - Use the composite key to attempt to chain (lookup) into `jvprl1`.
  - If found (`*in91` off), **delete the entry from `jvprl1`**.

#### Continue Loop

```rpg
c     jvarl8_key    reade     jvarl8                                 90
c                   enddo
```
- Read the next matching record from `jvarl8` and repeat until EOF (indicator 90 on).

---

### Program Termination

```rpg
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- Sets the LR (Last Record) indicator on (causing program to close files and clean up), and exits.

---

### Subroutine: *INZSR (Initialization Routine)

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
...
c                   endsr
```
- Defines key lists for file operations:
  - `jvarl8_key`: Single key field (`jvarl8_ldor`).
  - `jvprl1_key`: Composite key (`jvprl1_vare`, `jvprl1_ldor`).

---

## Summary

**What does this program do?**
- For all items (`jvvare`) from supplier number **54901** in `jvarl8`,  
- It tries to find and delete corresponding price entries in `jvprl1`
  - **With the same item number (`jvprl1_vare`)**
  - **But with supplier number `59097`** (note: this differs from where items are read, which is `54901`).
- If such an entry exists, it is deleted from `jvprl1`.

---

## Onboarding Notes

- **You should understand the business rules for why supplier 54901’s items are getting price deletions for supplier 59097.**
- Be careful with the hardcoded supplier numbers; these are critical "magic numbers" in the logic.
- The program is destructive—it deletes from the price file—so test carefully.
- The code style is classic (fixed-format) RPG IV.
