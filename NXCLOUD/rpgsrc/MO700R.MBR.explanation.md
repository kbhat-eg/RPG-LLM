## Overview

This RPG (Report Program Generator) IV source code is written for the IBM i (AS/400, iSeries) platform using the ILE (Integrated Language Environment) model. The program is named **MO700R** and its purpose is to provide the current date to a series of called "henteprogrammer" (fetch programs), specifically MO701R through MO707R (MO706R is commented out).

## Header and Configuration

```rpg
h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- **`option(*nodebugio)`**: Disables certain debugging input/output information, potentially for performance or production use.
- **`datedit(*dmy)`**: Sets date editing to day/month/year format for input/output operations.

---

## Documentation Comments

The code includes explanatory comments (in Norwegian) showing the program's name, purpose, history, and some versioning notes, helpful for maintainers.

## Data Definitions

```rpg
d w_dato1         s               d   datfmt(*iso)
d w_dato6         s              6  0
d w_datx          s              6
d                uds
d l_firm                944    946  0
```
- **w_dato1**: Date variable (type `d`), ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). Used to hold the current date.
- **w_dato6**: 6-digit numeric variable, zero decimal places. (Unused in the provided code.)
- **w_datx**: 6-character variable. Purpose not shown in active code.
- **uds**: A special RPG declaration for the User Data Structure (typically represents the RPG program's communication area; no subfields are named).
- **l_firm**: Three positions in the user data structure (fields 944 to 946), named `l_firm`. Not referenced in the logic shown.

## Main Logic

### Date Handling

```rpg
c                   time                    w_dato1
c                   subdur    1:*D          w_dato1
```
- **`time w_dato1`**: Retrieves the current system date/time (specifically the date part) into `w_dato1`.
- **`subdur 1:*D w_dato1`**: Subtracts 1 day from `w_dato1`. Thus, `w_dato1` ends up as yesterday's date.

### Calling Other Programs

```rpg
c                   call      'MO701R '
c                   parm                    w_dato1
... repeated for 'MO702R', 'MO703R', 'MO704R', 'MO705R'
5.60 c*                  call      'MO706R '
5.60 c*                  parm                    w_dato1
c                   call      'MO707R '
c                   parm                    w_dato1
```
- Calls each of the programs MO701R, MO702R, MO703R, MO704R, MO705R, **and MO707R** with the date `w_dato1` (yesterday's date) as a parameter.
- The call to MO706R is commented out and, per the comment, is now called from a CL program instead.

---

## Program Exit

```rpg
c     avslutt       tag
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- **`avslutt tag`**: Marks a label named 'avslutt' (Norwegian: "finish" or "end").
- **`eval *inlr = *on`**: Sets the last record indicator on, signaling RPG to close files and terminate the program after exit.
- **`return`**: Exits the program.

---

## Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
c                   endsr
```
- This is the RPG *INZSR (Initialization Subroutine), which runs automatically before the main logic. It is present but performs no actions.

---

## Summary

- The program calculates yesterday's date.
- It calls a sequence of "fetch" programs (MO701R–MO707R, except MO706R) and passes each the calculated date.
- The call to MO706R has been moved elsewhere (to CL).
- The program then ends cleanly.
- Data structures are declared for potential future use or for compatibility, but only `w_dato1` is actively used.

## Key Takeaways for New Developers

- **Purpose**: This program serves as a date distributor to other RPG programs, ensuring they all receive yesterday's date for their processing.
- **Extensibility**: You can add/remove called programs as needed, or modify how the date is calculated.
- **Integration**: The structure supports easy integration with other batch programs due to its modular call/parm pattern.
