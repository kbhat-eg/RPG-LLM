## Overview

This ILE RPG program (`AF711R`) is designed to write the current date and time to a logfile. The code is well-commented and structured, with a clear indication that this is a simple utility primarily for logging purposes.

---

### File Definition

```rpg
faflopf    o  a e             disk    rename(aflopf:aflopfr)
```
- **faflopf**: File declaration (presumably a log file).
- **o**: Output-capable.
- **a**: File is externally described.
- **e**: File is externally described.
- **disk**: Physical file.
- **rename(aflopf:aflopfr)**: Renames the record format from `aflopf` to `aflopfr` within the program.

---

### Variable Definitions

```rpg
d w_linje         s            200a   inz(*blank)
d w_tstmp         s               z
```
- **w_linje**: Work variable for a line, 200 characters, initialized to blanks.
- **w_tstmp**: Work variable for the timestamp, of type `z` (timestamp).

---

### Main Logic

```rpg
c                   time                    w_tstmp
```
- Retrieves the current system time and stores it in `w_tstmp`.

```rpg
c                   movel     w_tstmp       w_linje
```
- Moves the value of `w_tstmp` (timestamp) into `w_linje`, left-justified.

```rpg
c                   eval      SrcDta = w_linje
```
- Sets the field `SrcDta`—presumably a field in the log file record—to the value of `w_linje`.
  - **NOTE:** `SrcDta` is not defined in this program, so it must be a field in the externally described file record (`aflopfr`).

```rpg
c                   write     aflopfr
```
- Writes a new record to the log file with the current timestamp.

---

### Program End

```rpg
c     slutt         tag
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- **slutt tag**: Defines a label (not used by this simple program, possibly for future expansion).
- **eval *inlr = *on**: Sets the last record indicator to close the file and free resources on return.
- **return**: Exits the program.

---

### Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
c                   endsr
```
- Standard RPG initialization subroutine; currently empty.

## Summary

**What does this program do?**
- On execution, it fetches the current system timestamp, formats it into a 200-character string, assigns it to a data field in the log file record (presumably `SrcDta`), and writes this record to a log file.

**Use case:**  
- This is a logging utility, likely called by other programs or batch jobs to record an event's date and time for auditing or tracking purposes.

**Notes for onboarding developers:**
- The externally described file (`aflopf`, record format `aflopfr`) must exist and include a field named `SrcDta` (or similar) with at least 200 characters.
- This program does not process input parameters or complex logic; it only writes a single line per invocation.
- The program is easily extensible for more elaborate logging if needed.
