# Overview
This program, named JM740R, is an interactive workstation (WORKSTN) RPG application used in the ASVADM system to handle “Kampanje” (campaign) data in the Nobb integration format. It prompts a user for parameters (such as file name, campaign name, and folder path), validates those inputs, then calls additional programs to perform downstream data retrieval and processing.  

# Program Flow

## 1. Opening Screen (B1 Tag)
- The code begins by displaying the initial screen (`b1bld`) and waiting for user input.  
- It checks for function keys to exit (e.g., *INKC, *INKL). If pressed, it transfers control to the `avslutt` label to terminate the program.  

## 2. Validations  
1. If the file name (`b1filn`) is blank, indicator 31 is set, and a message screen (`b1msg`) is displayed, returning control to the initial tag.  
2. If the campaign name (`b1kamp`) is blank, indicator 32 is set, again returning to the initial screen.  
3. There is a specific length check on the campaign name. If it exceeds five characters, indicator 33 is set, and the user is prompted to correct it.  

## 3. Domain Logic and Defaults  
- The standard folder defaults to "PRIS_INN" when `b1fldr` is blank or not provided. This folder is likely used on the AS/400 (IBM i) to store or retrieve data files for pricing or campaign integration.  
- The campaign name (`b1kamp`) is restricted to five characters. This limitation is enforced to conform to existing business rules around campaign codes.  

## 4. Calling Supporting Programs  
After the inputs pass validations, the program calls other modules depending on user selections:

1. **JM740C**  
   - Called to handle data retrieval or setup.  
   - Receives the folder (`b1fldr`), file name (`b1filn`), and a feedback flag (`b_feil`).  
   - If `b_feil` is set to *ON upon return, an error message is displayed, and control returns to the opening screen.

2. **JM741R / JM742R**  
   - Once data retrieval is successful and no error flags are set, the program decides which secondary program to invoke based on the CSV option (`b1csvf`).  
   - If `b1csvf = 1`, JM742R is called (which handles CSV-specific logic). Otherwise, JM741R is invoked for standard processing.  

## 5. Termination
- The `avslutt` label sets *INLR = *ON, ending program execution in a standard RPG manner.  

# Notable Points
- The code uses indicators (31, 32, 33, etc.) tied to specific fields on the display file (JM740D). This is a common pattern in legacy-style RPG interactive programs, where each indicator’s logic is handled in-screen design and turned on or off in the mainline code.  
- The default folder “PRIS_INN” has been emphasized and overridden in later versions. This suggests a convention within the system to place inbound pricing or campaign files in this folder.  
- The commented-out logic for CSV file readiness (in version 6.32) reveals historical development steps and suggests incremental adoption of CSV functionality.  

# Conclusion
JM740R is a parameter-driven interactive front-end for campaign data handling within the Nobb integration workflow. It sets up user inputs, validates them, and delegates specific tasks to supporting modules (JM740C, JM741R, and JM742R). The key domain rules—particularly the five-character campaign code limit and default folder usage—ensure the consistency of campaign data processing throughout the ASVADM system.
