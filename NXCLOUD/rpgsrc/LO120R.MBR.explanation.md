# RPG Program Overview

This RPG (Report Program Generator) source code is for an IBM i (AS/400) system. The program name is **LO120R** and it is part of the **ASLAGR** system. The program's main function is the printing ("utskrift") of purchase orders ("bestilling/innkjøp").

## Header Section

The comments at the top provide metadata:
- **System:** ASLAGR
- **Program:** LO120R
- **Description:** Printing of orders/purchases
- The template includes space for versioning, references, and change descriptions.

## File and Data Definitions

```rpg
D                UDS
D  DSSFIR               944    946  0
```

- `UDS` indicates the definition of a user data structure.
- `DSSFIR` is a field, presumably in the LDA (Local Data Area), occupying positions 944 to 946 (3 digits, no decimals).

## Mainline Logic

### Initialization

The program begins by clearing (zeroing out) certain working variables:

```rpg
C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPSPOR
C                   MOVE      *ZERO         HEDNUM
C                   MOVE      *ZERO         HEDSUF
```
- `WPSPOR` is set to blank.
- `HEDNUM` and `HEDSUF` set to zero.

### Call External Program

```rpg
C                   CALL      'LOSPOR'
C                   PARM                    WPSPOR
C                   PARM                    HEDFIR
C                   PARM                    HEDNUM
C                   PARM                    HEDSUF
C                   PARM                    WPXSPO
C                   PARM                    WPXOTY
C                   PARM                    WPXUSE
C                   PARM                    WPXLDO
C                   PARM                    WPXVLG
```

- The program calls an external program named `LOSPOR`.
- It passes several parameters, which are likely all working fields related to the order being processed.

### Program End

```rpg
C     XSLUTT        TAG

C                   SETON                                        LR
C                   RETURN
```

- `XSLUTT TAG` is a label, used for readability and potential jump (GOTO) purposes.
- `SETON LR` signals the end of the RPG cycle and marks the program for termination.
- `RETURN` exits the program.

## Subroutine Section

### *INZSR Subroutine

This is the standard initialization subroutine called automatically at program start.

```rpg
C     *INZSR        BEGSR

C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPSPOR            1
C                   MOVE      *ZERO         HEDFIR            3 0
C                   MOVE      *ZERO         HEDNUM            6 0
C                   MOVE      *ZERO         HEDSUF            2 0

C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPXSPO            1
C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPXOTY            2
C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPXUSE           10
C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPXLDO            6 0
C                   MOVE      *BLANK        WPXVLG            1

C                   MOVE      DSSFIR        HEDFIR

CSR                 ENDSR
```

- The subroutine sets all the main variables to blank or zero depending on their type and length.
- `HEDFIR` (probably the company/firm number) is loaded from field `DSSFIR` (from the LDA).

## Key Variables

- **WPSPOR, WPXSPO, WPXOTY, WPXUSE, WPXLDO, WPXVLG:** Working variables likely corresponding to various order details.
- **HEDFIR:** Company/firm number (set from LDA).
- **HEDNUM, HEDSUF:** Probably order number and suffix.
- **DSSFIR:** Firm/company code from LDA.

## General Flow

1. **Initialization:** Set variables to blanks/zeroes; copy in firm number.
2. **Main Processing:** Reset key fields; call external order-processing program with all necessary parameters.
3. **End Processing:** Cleanly exit the program.

## Comments and Structure

- Most comments are written in Norwegian, describing section purpose and variable resets.
- The code is structured in classic fixed-format RPG, using operation codes (`MOVE`, `CALL`, `SETON`, `RETURN`, etc.).
- Subroutines are used for initialization.
- The program depends on external programs and standard system areas (like the LDA).

---

**Summary:**  
This RPG program is an order/purchase print program that initializes relevant data, sets the company/firm from the LDA, calls another program (`LOSPOR`) to handle the actual order processing, and then ends. All relevant data fields are carefully blanked or zeroed both at the start and before the call for good data hygiene.
