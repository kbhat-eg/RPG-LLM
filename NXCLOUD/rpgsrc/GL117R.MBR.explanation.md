# RPG Program Overview

This RPG program (`GL117R`) is part of the ASOKON system and is designed to retrieve a company name ("firmanavn") based on input parameters. The comments and variable names suggest the program was tailored for Norwegian users.

---

## 1. **Header and Documentation**

The initial comment block (`/TITLE ...`) provides metadata:
- **System**: ASOKON
- **Program**: GL117R
- **Description**: Fetches company name
- **History**: Created January 27, 1995, by RH

It also documents the indicator usage:
- `KC = F3`: Exit
- `KL = F12`: Cancel
- `LR`: End program
- `60-69`: File operation indicators (e.g., CHAIN)

---

## 2. **File Declaration**

```rpg
fafirl1    if   e           k disk
```
- **fafirl1**: A file (likely a database table) accessed by key (`k`), externally described (`e`), for input (`if`).

---

## 3. **Work Field (Variable) Declarations**

```rpg
d w_bgir          s             11  0
d w_firm          s              3  0
d w_fnav          s             30
d w_pgir          s             11  0
```
- **w_bgir**: Numeric, 11 digits, 0 decimals. (Likely company/organization number)
- **w_firm**: Numeric, 3 digits, 0 decimals. (Company ID)
- **w_fnav**: Character, 30 chars. (Company name)
- **w_pgir**: Numeric, 11 digits, 0 decimals. (Possibly parent organization number)

---

## 4. **Program End Routine**

```rpg
c     xslutt        tag
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- **xslutt**: Tag for end-of-program logic.
- Sets *LR (Last Record indicator) ON, signaling program end and cleanup.
- Returns control to caller.

---

## 5. **Initialization Subroutine (INZSR)**

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
```
- This is the initialization subroutine run at program entry.

### Parameter List

```rpg
c     *entry        plist
c                   parm                    w_firm
c                   parm                    w_fnav
c                   parm                    w_bgir
c                   parm                    w_pgir
```
- The program uses a parameter list to receive values from the caller:
    - **w_firm**: Passed in (company ID)
    - **w_fnav**: Passed in and out (company name)
    - **w_bgir**: Passed in and out (org number)
    - **w_pgir**: Passed in and out (parent org number)

### Initialize Variables

```rpg
c                   eval      w_bgir = 0
c                   eval      w_pgir = 0
c                   eval      w_fnav = *blanks
c                   movel     '*UKJENT'     w_fnav
```
- Sets org numbers to zero.
- Sets company name to blanks, then moves '*UKJENT' ('*UNKNOWN' in Norwegian) into `w_fnav` as the default value.

### Read Company Info

```rpg
c     w_firm        chain     afirl1                             60
```
- Does a keyed read (CHAIN) of the file `fafirl1` using `w_firm` as the key.
- If found, indicator 60 is set OFF.

#### If Company is Found

```rpg
c                   if        *in60 = *off
c                   movel     aafnav        w_fnav
c                   eval      w_bgir = aafbgi
c                   eval      w_pgir = aafpgi
c                   endif
```
- If record is found:
    - Moves the company name (`aafnav`) from file to `w_fnav`.
    - Sets `w_bgir` to `aafbgi` (fetched org number).
    - Sets `w_pgir` to `aafpgi` (fetched parent org number).

#### Note:
- **aafnav, aafbgi, aafpgi** are presumably fields in the file `fafirl1`.

### End the Subroutine

```rpg
c                   endsr
```
- Ends the initialization subroutine.

## 6. **Summary**

- The program is structured to be called with a company ID.
- It initializes output variables, attempts to find the company in `fafirl1`. If found, it retrieves and returns the company name and organization numbers.
- If not found, it returns '*UKJENT' as the company name, and zero for organization numbers.

---

## 7. **Typical Use**

A calling program would pass four variables by reference:
- Supply a company ID.
- Receive back the company name and related numbers, or default values if not found.

---

## 8. **Key RPG Features Used**

- Parameter list (`plist`/`parm`) for subprogram parameter handling.
- File I/O via `CHAIN` and use of file indicators.
- Use of *INZSR for initialization instead of main-line code.
- Use of indicators (*IN60, *INLR) for file and program control.

## In Short

This is a simple lookup program, typically integrated into larger business applications for displaying or using company information based on a unique ID.
