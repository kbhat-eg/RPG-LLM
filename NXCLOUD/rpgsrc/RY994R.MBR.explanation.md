# RPG Program Explanation: RY994R (KONV540: Update Supplier)

## Overview

This RPG (Report Program Generator) program, identified as `RY994R` (KONV540: Oppdaterer leverandør), is designed to update records in a physical file named `JLEVPFR` (renamed as `JLEVLUR` internally). The main function is to set the value of the field `JLODAT` to that of `JLEDAT` for all records in the file.

## Source Structure Breakdown

### Control Specifications

```rpg
     h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- `option(*nodebugio)`: Prevents generation of Debug I/O information (for smaller object size).
- `datedit(*dmy)`: Specifies the default edit code for date fields as Day/Month/Year.

---

### File Specification

```rpg
     fjlevlu    uf   e           k disk    rename(jlevpfr:jlevlur)
```
- This defines a file called `JLEVLU`:
  - `u`: User-controlled open.
  - `f`: Full procedural file.
  - `e`: External description (uses DDS for field definitions).
  - `k`: File is keyed (access via key possible).
  - `disk`: File type is disk.
  - `rename(jlevpfr:jlevlur)`: The externally described file `JLEVPFR` is renamed locally as `JLEVLUR`.

### Main Program Logic

#### 1. Read and Process Each Record

```rpg
     c                   read      jlevlur
     c                   dow       not %eof
      *
     c                   eval      jlodat = jledat
     c                   update    jlevlur
      *
     c                   read      jlevlur
     c                   enddo
```
- `read jlevlur`: Read the next record from the file.
- `dow not %eof`: Loop while not at End-Of-File.
- `eval jlodat = jledat`: For the current record, set the value of field `JLODAT` equal to the value of field `JLEDAT`.
- `update jlevlur`: Write the updated record back to the file.
- This loop processes all records in the file (`JLEVLUR`).

#### 2. Program Termination

```rpg
     c     avslutt       tag
      *
     c                   eval      *inlr = *on
     c                   return
```
- `avslutt tag`: A label for the end of the program (not strictly necessary unless branched to).
- `eval *inlr = *on`: Sets the last record indicator, which closes files and ends the program cleanly.
- `return`: Exits the program.

---

#### 3. Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
     c     *inzsr        begsr
      *
     c                   endsr
```
- `*inzsr begsr ... endsr`: Standard initialization subroutine block, currently empty but available for any initialization code needed.

---

## Key Points

- **Purpose**: Update each record in the supplier file so that `JLODAT` is set to the value in `JLEDAT`.
- **File Handling**: Iterates over the entire file.
- **Field Logic**: Only the two fields (`JLODAT`, `JLEDAT`) are directly manipulated.
- **Program Structure**: Simple sequential processing with clean start and shutdown.
- **Internationalization**: The description and comments are in Norwegian.

---

## Typical Usage

This type of program would be used for mass-updating a field across all records in a file, possibly as part of a conversion, migration, or data clean-up process.

---

## Further Notes

- You may want to check the field definitions for `JLODAT` and `JLEDAT` in the DDS of `JLEVPFR` for clarity.
- If more complex logic or error handling is needed, it can be added in the processing loop.
