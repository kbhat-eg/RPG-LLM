# RPG Program Explanation (AX018R)

This RPG (Report Program Generator) program is written for the IBM i platform, using the classic (fixed-format) RPG IV (ILE RPG) style. Below is an explanation of its components, variables, and logic.

---

## Header Section

```rpg
h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```

- `option(*nodebugio)`: Disables debug I/O operations, typically done for production programs.
- `datedit(*dmy)`: Sets the default date format to Day-Month-Year.

---

## Program Description & Version History

The extensive comments describe the program usage, version history, and references:
- **Program Name**: AX018R
- **Description**: A warning/notification screen that requires a response (as per Norwegian comment "Varselbilde som krever svar").
- **Version History**: Including rollout notes for specific requests (e.g., NXS-4426).

---

## File Definition

```rpg
fax018d    cf   e             workstn
```
- Defines a workstation file `AX018D` (display file) for user interaction.

---

## Variables and Parameters

### Standalone Fields

```rpg
d p_in12          s              1  0
d w_acli          s              2  0
d w_acpo          s              3  0
```

- `p_in12`: Temporary or parameter variable (1-digit packed decimal).
- `w_acli`: Working storage, 2-digit packed decimal.
- `w_acpo`: Working storage, 3-digit packed decimal.

## Main Program Logic

### Initialization

```rpg
c                   z-add     10            w_acli
c                   z-add     12            w_acpo
```
- Sets initial values:
  - `w_acli` to 10
  - `w_acpo` to 12

### Display Interaction

```rpg
c                   exfmt     m1win
```
- Displays format `M1WIN` on the workstation file and waits for user input. The display file (`AX018D`) defines this format.

### User Response Handling

```rpg
c                   if        *inkl = *on
c                   eval      p_in12 = 1
c                   endif
```
- Checks if indicator `*INKL` (likely tied to a function key or user response on the display file) is on.
- If so, sets `p_in12` to 1, indicating the action/response was taken.

---

## Program Termination

```rpg
c                   eval      *inlr = *on
c                   return
```
- Sets the last record indicator (`*INLR`) to on, signaling program termination and cleanup.
- Exits the program.

---

## Initialization Subroutine (*INZSR)

```rpg
c     *inzsr        begsr
c                   z-add     0             w_acli
c                   z-add     0             w_acpo
c                   z-add     0             p_in12
```
- The special subroutine `*INZSR` runs automatically when the program starts.
- Initializes `w_acli`, `w_acpo`, and `p_in12` to 0.

### Parameter List

```rpg
c     *entry        plist
c                   parm                    m1mld1
c                   parm                    m1mld2
c                   parm                    m1svar
c                   parm                    p_in12
```
- Defines the program's parameter list:
    - `m1mld1`, `m1mld2`: Presumably message lines or display fields.
    - `m1svar`: Probably a variable for a user response or status.
    - `p_in12`: Passed by reference for output.

---

## Summary

- The program presents a warning/confirmation screen to the user and waits for a response.
- If a particular response is given (indicator `*INKL` is set), it updates a parameter (`p_in12`) to signal this to the caller.
- Variables `w_acli` and `w_acpo` appear to be used to control values on the display, though their application depends on the display file logic (`AX018D`).
- The program is modular, with an initialization subroutine and parameter handling, making it suitable for call/response integration in a larger system.

---

## Key Concepts for Onboarding

- **Workstation File (`AX018D`)**: Defines what the user sees and can interact with.
- **Indicators (e.g., `*INKL`)**: Used to detect user actions such as pressing keys.
- **Parameter Passing**: The program can be called by other programs and pass data back and forth via parameters.
- **Subroutines**: `*INZSR` is used for "on startup" initialization.
