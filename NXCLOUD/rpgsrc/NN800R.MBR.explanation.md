# RPG Program Explanation

This RPG program is designed to interact with a database file called `ANBLPFR`, likely representing a file group in a web store (nettbutikk). It retrieves information about a specific file group based on provided parameters and handles possible errors.

## Program Metadata and Comments
- The header comments describe the program name (`NN800R`), description (`Nettbutikk, API - hent filgruppe`), and revision history.
- The program is compiled with debugging options disabled (`option(*nodebugio)`), and date editing is set to display in `MM/DD/YYYY` format (`datedit(*dmy)`).

## File Definition
- `fanbll1` is defined as a disk file with the key fields `anblpfr` (file group identifier). It is renamed to `anbll1r` internally for processing.

## Data Definitions
- Parameters:
  - `p_eier`, `p_buti`, `p_fgrp`, `p_feil` are parameters received from outside the program, representing owner, facility, file group, and error indicator respectively.
  - `p_eier` and `p_buti` are identifiers for the lookup criteria.
  - `p_fgrp` will hold the retrieved file group.
  - `p_feil` is used to flag errors.
- Local variables:
  - `anbll1_leie` and `anbll1_lbut` are working variables configured to match the structure of `aoleie` and `aolbut` respectively, facilitating data handling and comparison.

## Main Logic
### Fetching File Group from Database
1. The program assigns the parameter values `p_eier` and `p_buti` to local variables `anbll1_leie` and `anbll1_lbut`.
2. It performs a `CHAIN` operation on the file `anbll1` using `anbll1_key` (which is composed of `anbll1_leie` and `anbll1_lbut`) as the key.
3. If the record is **not found** (`%found` is false), it sets the error indicator `p_feil` to *on* and jumps to the `avslutt` label to terminate processing.
4. If found, it extracts the file group code (`aolfgr`) from the database record and stores it in parameter `p_fgrp`.
5. It also sets the system variable `dssfir` with the value of `aolfir`, presumably setting the firm or company context for subsequent operations.

### Program Termination
- The `avslutt` label marks the end of processing:
  - It sets the indicator `*inlr = *on` to signal the program to close and release resources.
  - The program then returns to the caller.

## Error Handling Routine
- The error subroutine (`*pssr`):
  1. Sets `p_feil` to *on*, indicating an error occurred.
  2. Jumps to the `avslutt` label to clean up and exit.

## Initialization Subroutine
- The initialization subroutine (`*inzsr`):
  1. Accepts parameters for the lookup key (`p_eier` and `p_buti`) via the parameter list.
  2. Sets up the key for the lookup operation in `anbll1_key` by specifying the fields `anbll1_leie` and `anbll1_lbut`.
  3. Ends, ready for the main processing.

## Summary
This program performs a database lookup to retrieve a file group code based on owner and facility identifiers. It manages errors gracefully, sets system variables for context, and follows standard RPG modules for initialization and cleanup, making it suitable for API calls within a larger system.
