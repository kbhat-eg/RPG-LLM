# RPG Program VD750R - Explanation

This program, **VD750R**, is a simple ILE RPG/400 program coded in the traditional (fixed-format) RPG IV style. It is designed to interact with a display file and call another program as part of its processing.

Below is a breakdown of each section and its purpose:

---

## Header Specifications

```rpg
     h option(*nodebugio) datedit(*dmy)
```
- **option(*nodebugio):** Disables the generation of debug data for display, input, or output operations (for performance).
- **dateedit(*dmy):** Dates will be edited in Day/Month/Year format.

---

## File Specifications

```rpg
     fvv950d    cf   e             workstn
```
- Declares a display file **vv950d** as a *workstation file* (Workstn).
- `cf` = Control file (used for display).
- `e` = Entries/external descriptions used.

## Main Logic Flow

### Program Start & Initial Display

```rpg
     c     b1tag         tag
```
- Defines a *tag* labeled `b1tag`. Used as a control point in the program.

```rpg
     c                   exfmt     b1bld
```
- **exfmt b1bld:** Displays and formats the screen named `b1bld` from the display file, allowing user interaction.

### Function Key Handling

```rpg
     c                   if        *inkc or *inkl
     c                   goto      avslutt
     c                   endif
```
- Checks if special function keys have been pressed (typically F3/F12 for Exit/Cancel).
  - **\*INKC** and **\*INKL** are indicator variables set by function key presses.
- If so, jumps to the label `avslutt` to end the program.

---

### Program Call

```rpg
     c                   call      'VV950C'
```
- Calls the program `VV950C` (possibly to update or process records).

---

### Batch Job Notification

```rpg
     c                   exfmt     b1sbm
```
- Formats and displays the `b1sbm` screen, typically to inform the user that a batch job is submitted or to collect further input.

---

## Program Exit

```rpg
     c     avslutt       tag
     c                   eval      *inlr = *on
     c                   return
```
- `avslutt` label: Jump point for exiting.
- **eval *inlr = *on:** Sets the Last Record indicator to *ON, which closes all files and ends the program cleanly.
- **return:** Exits the program.

---

## Initialization Subroutine

```rpg
     c     *inzsr        begsr
     c                   endsr
```
- Defines an empty initialization subroutine (`*inzsr`). This would execute automatically at program start, but contains no code here.

---

# Summary

- **VD750R** is a simple, display file–driven RPG program.
- It presents an initial screen (`b1bld`), reacts to function keys (exit or cancel).
- On continue, it calls an external program (`VV950C`), then displays another screen (`b1sbm`).
- Uses standard RPG cycle with clear entry and exit points.
- There is an (empty) initialization subroutine for any future initial logic.

### Onboarding Tips

- **Display Files (`vv950d`):** Check the DDS source for `vv950d` to see what the screens `b1bld` and `b1sbm` look like and which fields are used.
- **Function Keys:** Identify which keys correspond to `*INKC` and `*INKL` (usually F3/F12).
- **External Program (`VV950C`):** Understand what this program does; this is likely the main “processing” work.
- **Message Flow:** The sequence is prompt → process → notify user → end.

This is a basic control program meant for simple user-driven work and program invocation.
