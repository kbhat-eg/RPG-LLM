          Provide markdown output describing the validation logic and calculations that occur during invoice processing, after orders have been selected. Include these sections:

          ## Product and Pricing Rules
          - Product validation during invoice creation
          - Price validation and application
          - Quantity validation on invoice lines

          - Product group discount handling
          - Special discounts (bruksrett) validation

          - Rounding difference tolerance (±0.05 øre)

          NOTE: Do NOT include order validation rules (customer exists, order status, order locks, user authorization). Those belong in sales-order-business-rules.md.

          Format as markdown with this structure:
          - Each rule has: Logic, File, Field, Condition sections
          - Group rules by the categories above
          - Include subprogram calls section
          - Include summary of critical blocking conditions

          Use DB2 TABLE.COLUMN notation where identifiable.

          IMPORTANT: Do NOT include SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements). Instead, use plain English explanations with:
          - 'What is checked' descriptions
          - 'Why this is required' reasoning
          - 'What happens when...' scenarios
          - Real-world examples with actual values
          - Conversational, simple language
