          Extract INVOICE PROCESSING RULES. Document the business logic that occurs DURING invoice calculation and creation, AFTER orders have been selected.

          ## Product and Pricing Rules
          - Product validation during invoice creation
          - Price validation and application
          - Quantity validation on invoice lines

          - Tax rate matching and application
          - Tax base amount calculation (Quantity × Price - Discounts)
          - Tax amount calculation and rounding (Norwegian rules)

          - Customer discount application from RKUNPF (RERAB1, RERAB2, RERAB3)
          - Discount cascade calculation sequence
          - Product group discount handling
          - Special discounts (bruksrett) validation

          - Deposit amount validation from SDEPPFR
          - Deposit deduction from final invoice (SOFORS field)
          - Deposit invoice vs. final invoice type handling

          ## Total Calculation Rules
          - Line totals summation logic
          - Invoice header total calculation (SOFSUM)
          - Rounding difference tolerance (±0.05 øre)
          - Zero-value invoice handling

          ## Payment and KID Rules
          - Payment terms validation and due date calculation
          - KID (Customer ID) number generation via RN012R

          - Accounting period validation (AARRF.ARSTRT)
          - System lock checks via FA730R
          - Invoice number sequence generation

          NOTE: Do NOT include order validation rules (customer exists, order status, order locks, user authorization). Those belong in sales-order-business-rules.md.

          Format as markdown with this structure:
          - Each rule has: Logic, File, Field, Condition sections
          - Group rules by the categories above
          - Include subprogram calls section
          - Include summary of critical blocking conditions
          - Include invoice processing flow diagram

          Use DB2 TABLE.COLUMN notation where identifiable.

          IMPORTANT: Do NOT include SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements). Instead, use plain English explanations with:
          - 'What is checked' descriptions
          - 'Why this is required' reasoning
          - 'What happens when...' scenarios
          - Real-world examples with actual values
          - Conversational, simple language
